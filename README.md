# violence-against-christians
A project that maps violence against Christians in India using data from the Evangelical Fellows of India. While the gathering was done manually with the help of the annual reports, the visualising was done on Datawrapper. The state graphs were made on ggplot using R.
# Data
Data is collated from the [Annual Reports of the EFI](https://efionline.org/category/rlc-reports/). The data collected sorts violence by state and months of Incidence.
The map shading, which indicates what the status of anti-convesrion bills were compiled manually after a statewide analysis. 
### Notebook - [analysis.ipynb](analysis.ipynb) 
This notebook sorts the data for Karnataka and Harayana and plots them onto ggplot
## Limitations
While this data does contain information on the kinds of violence that members of churches and the church-affiliated institutions go through, it DOES NOT contain information on regular practising christians who are targeted. For example, the data indicates a drop in incidents in Tamil Nadu from 2018. However, different collecations, as well as a close following of the news indicates that incidents in the state were on the [rise](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/systematic-attack-christians-tamil-nadu-s-hindutva-laboratory-168941). The data collected by the United Christian Forum indicates a rise of attacks against christians.
